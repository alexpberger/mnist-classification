In this Project I solve the MNIST (known as the *Hello World* of Deep Learning) using TensorFlow. Specifically, I try a *densely connected network* and a *convolutional network* (convents). I then compare their performance.

MNIST is a data set of Handwritten Digits, and thus a Multiclass Image Classification Problem.

See *Notebook.pdf* for results.
